<strong>Introduction</strong>

BrewFlight is an app designed for beer enthusiasts who are interested in exploring new beers based on their flavor preferences. BrewFlight allows a user to view an index of different beers based on the style of beer OR to search for beers by selecting a number of flavor attributes they're keen on and running a function that returns a "flight" of 6 suggested beers to try based on matching the selected flavor attributes.

Built With:
    - Ruby
    - Rails
    - Bootstrap

<strong>Usage</strong>

A user can create a profile, or login if they already have a profile.  The user can view all available beers from the main page or start a search based on selected flavor attributes.  The search returns a "flight" of 6 suggested beers matching one or more of the flavor attributes selected.  The user can then place an order for that flight, generate a new flight, or go back to the main menu.  A user can also 'like' a beer, either from their previous orders or from the index view, which will then be shown on their user page as a 'favorite'.  A user can also update or delete their profile if desired.
